This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the Omi Windows application, including setup, testing procedures, and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Windows 10 (version 1903 or later) or Windows 11
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Git for Windows
- Administrator privileges for audio permission testing

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Verify Flutter installation
flutter doctor -v

# Check Windows toolchain
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

## Windows-Specific Components

### Audio Capture System
The Windows app uses platform-specific audio capture through:
- `windows/audio_capture_windows.cpp` - Native audio implementation
- `lib/services/audio_capture_service.dart` - Dart interface
- Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI) integration

### Key Files to Monitor
- `windows/runner/main.cpp` - Application entry point
- `windows/runner/win32_window.cpp` - Window management
- `windows/audio_capture_windows.cpp` - Audio capture implementation
- `windows/CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Build Testing

#### Debug Build
```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd /path/to/omi/app

# Clean previous builds
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build for Windows (debug)
flutter build windows --debug

# Run from build directory
cd build/windows/runner/Debug
./omi.exe
```

#### Release Build
```bash
# Build release version
flutter build windows --release

# Test release build
cd build/windows/runner/Release
./omi.exe
```

#### Profile Build (for performance testing)
```bash
# Build profile version
flutter build windows --profile

# Run with performance monitoring
cd build/windows/runner/Profile
./omi.exe
```

### 2. Audio Functionality Testing

#### Microphone Permission Testing

- Test with multiple audio applications running
- Test with system audio muted
- Test with very low/high microphone levels

### 3. Memory Management Testing

#### Memory Leak Detection
```bash
# Run with memory profiling
flutter run --profile --target=lib/main.dart

- Check focus indicators

### 5. Integration Testing

#### Backend Connectivity
```bash
# Test API endpoints
# Verify authentication flow
# Test data synchronization
```

#### File System Operations
- Test log file creation and rotation
- Verify temporary file cleanup
- Test with limited disk space
- Check file permissions

### 6. Error Handling Testing

#### Network Issues
- Test with no internet connection
- Test with intermittent connectivity
- Test with slow/high latency connections
- Verify offline mode functionality

#### System Resource Constraints

   - Test with different buffer sizes

### Performance Issues
1. **High CPU usage**
   - Check for debug mode vs release mode
   - Monitor background processes
   - Verify audio processing efficiency

2. **Memory leaks**
   - Use Flutter DevTools for memory profiling
   - Check native code for proper resource cleanup
   - Monitor long-running sessions

### Build Issues
1. **CMake errors**

## 🚀 Next Steps for Windows Machine

### Step 1: Windows Development Environment Setup
```cmd
# Required Software (install in this order):
1. Git for Windows
2. Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition with:
   - C++ CMake tools for Visual Studio

cd omi/app

# 2. Configure Flutter
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter doctor -v

# 3. Verify environment files exist (they should from Linux work)
dir .dev.env .prod.env

# 4. Install dependencies

2. **Device Switching**: Test hot-plugging audio devices
3. **Audio Quality**: Verify 16kHz sample rate capture
4. **Background Recording**: Test app backgrounding during recording
5. **Multiple Audio Sources**: Test with different microphone types

### Performance Monitoring
```cmd
# Monitor during testing:
# - CPU usage during audio capture
# - Memory consumption over time
# - Audio buffer underruns
# - UI responsiveness during recording
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

5. Test with Windows Defender/antivirus disabled temporarily

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The Windows app is ready for production testing when:
- ✅ Clean build with no errors
- ✅ Audio capture works reliably
- ✅ UI is responsive and scales properly
- ✅ No memory leaks during extended use
- ✅ Proper error handling for edge cases

---

**Last Updated**: Built successfully on Linux (Flutter 3.32.4), ready for Windows compilation and testing.

**Project State**: All dependencies resolved, code generated, environment configured with dummy values (update with real API keys).

**Critical Path**: The Windows audio capture component (`windows_audio_capture.cpp`) is the most important feature to test as it's platform-specific and cannot be verified on Linux.
